- Used Memory  ∼ 125 MB (Up to 260MB on search)
- Processor Usage ∼ 0% (Up to ∼ 42% on search)
- Searching Time ∼ 19 Minutes (On a 500GB SSD, searching for "qt")
- Found Files and Folders: 22756
### Pocket Computer Manager
- Executable's size - 128 KB ~ **74 Times Less**
- Used Memory  ∼ 20 MB (Up to 46MB on search) ~ **6 Times Less**
- Processor Usage ∼ 0% (Up to ∼ 26.6% on search) - **Up to 1.5 Times Less**
- Searching Time - Down to 24 Seconds (On a 500GB SSD, searching for "qt") - **47.5 Times Faster**
